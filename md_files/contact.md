## Want to help out?

We're all volunteers in the community so any skills you feel you could contribute would always be welcome, even if you aren't sure how you could help out but are still willing. Non technical skills such as design, event organisation, PR as well as technical skills will all be considered.

Contact us on our email address with your background, skills you may have as well as your availability, thank you.
