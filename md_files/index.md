We’re a community of like-minded individuals in Dublin with a passion for Linux and all things free (as in free speech) and open source software. Whether you’re a seasoned Linux user or someone who would simply like to learn more please feel free to come along to one of our regular meetups or follow us through one of our social accounts below. If chatting is more your thing you can find us on Telegram. We are a pretty active group!

***Our next meetup***  We have regular meetups (currently virtual). For more info please checkout our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Linux-Community/?target=_blank).
